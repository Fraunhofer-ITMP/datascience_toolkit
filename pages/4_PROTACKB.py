st.markdown("### Description")
st.write("**PROTACKB** is a comprehensive knowledgebase of PROTACs, molecular glues and degraders developed with the motive to harmonize and "
         "consolidate relevant data from public databases, patents and ProxiDrugs project. As of now, it consists of 15 types of entities "
         "(**27K unique nodes**) and **115K relationships** which are represented using graph theory based data structure model. The entities are enriched with knowledge from curated databases such as Ubinet, OpenTargets, UniProt "
         "and ChEMBL. The PROTACKB is hosted in Neo4j, a visualization tool with intuitive graphical user interface (GUI). The access to Neo4j server is through "
         "personalized login credentials and is only available to members of ProxiDrugs consortium. Additional information about ProxiDrugs can be found [here](https://www.proxidrugs.de/).")

st.markdown("### General workflow")
st.write("The process of creating PROTACKB involves various steps for normalizing and standardizing chemical representations of entities such as PROTACs, linkers, warheads, "
         "e3 binders, glues and degraders. These include conversion of SDF structures to SMILES/InChI, removal of salts from structures, removal of invalid structures, "
         "generation of canonical SMILES and InChI key and finally assignment of unique identifiers (CBDREGNo.) to entities. Afterwards, using SMILES/InChI Key as a query to "
         "ChEMBL and OpenTargets API, the knowledge about mechanism of action, associated disease and adverse effect is retrieved (if any). Similary, proteins are first mapped to "
         "UniProt database and enriched with the knowledge of associated pathway, molecular function and biological process using UniProt's API. The e3 ligases are enriched with "
         "knowledge from UbiNet which are about classes of e3 ligases and domain structure. This knowledge is represented in the form of triples (i.e., :blue[subject]-:red[_predicate_]"
         "-:green[object] which are the building blocks of PROTACKB. For Examples: :blue[**PROTAC123**] :red[**_hasWarhead_**] :green[**Warhead456**] and :blue[**Warhead456**] :red[**_Targets_**] :green[**TYK2**]. The entity specific metadata is added to the corresponding entity, for instance: "
         "chemical structures will always have descriptors such as Mol Wt, TPSA, HBA, HBD, etc. and protein will mostly have UniProt id and links to external databases. The PROTACKB entities "
         "are also cross-linked to the PROXIDRUGSDB which is a database for assay and experimental data generated in ProxiDrugs.")
