# streamlit_ITMP
attempts to build streamlit apps for different usage.

## Pareto front
This app allows to upload screening results, to generate a hit Pareto front according to unweighted choice of numerical columns, display of the screening results on first two columns used for Pareto front calculation, mouse on scatter plot generation via Bokeh and download possibility of same input excel with extra column with labels of Pareto front chosen. Needs extra content like clearer trend towards positive control (maximize) or negative control (minimize). Possible discretization of columns with quantiles (e.g. instead of max or min only use 4th quartile (maximize) or 1st quartile (minimize). Weights to be added is needed. in case of HCS (high content screening) columns could be ten or hundreds, i.e. need a different selection tool.
